Do you care about contributing to open-source, and appreciate a good challenge? We do too! :)
Open-source

\We are a team of veteran open-source developers, working on educational and community-based
projects in an open-first environment ~ and we are looking for new members. By joining us, you will work
fulltime on open-source, pushing your changes to free software projects upstream through pull requests,
contributing features, documentation, or help on public forums.

We care deeply about contributing our work upstream. You will see the results of your work reused and
recognized across the educational community, increasing access to quality education for everyone,
everywhere:

Remote-first

Unlike companies who reluctantly started to accept remote workers recently, we have embraced it from
day 1. For the past 7 years, we have based and refined our way of working around remote-friendly
workflows, from the ground up. No day-long video meetings, mandatory work hours, or risk of being
forced back into an office one day ~ as long as you have a good internet connection, it's none of our
business when or where you work from. -)

We are all working remotely, from all continents (except Antarctica, at least so far- applicants welcome!)
We use remote-friendly and timezone-agnostic workflows based on asynchronous principles and good
documentation practices.
